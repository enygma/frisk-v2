Frisk : Lightweight Functional Testing
#######################

Frisk is functional testing framework designed to be run from the command line. It 
allows for simple gets/posts and passing the results through assertions to test the 
resulting content.

Requirements
--------------
> PHP 5.3+
> pecl_http extension

Instructions:
--------------

Currently assertions are working, but test handling is still in progress.

You can run the sample code for now by:
 - making "frisk.php" executable
 - changing the php path at the top of the file
 - ./frisk.php
